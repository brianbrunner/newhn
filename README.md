# newHN

A Chrome extension that puts the newest posts on Hacker News at the top on the front page.

## Why?

Before a post hits the front page, it starts out on the new page. Most users never actually check new, meaning that it's a small subset of fairly dedicated users who actually decide what the majority of HN users see.

This Chrome extension is a small attempt to remedy that. By putting a few new posts at the top of the front page, you can maintain your normal browsing patterns while actively participating in deciding what will hit the front page next.
